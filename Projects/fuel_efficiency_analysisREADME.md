# Fuel Efficiency Regression Analysis - R

Goal: Analyze how weight, horsepower, cylinders & transmission affect MPG.  
Dataset: 'mtcars' (built-in R dataset)

---

## Methods
- Data loading & summary
- EDA with scatterplots + boxplots
- Simple & multiple regression models
- ANOVA model comparison
- Regression diagnostics + coefficient plot

---

## Results
- Weight has strongest negative effect on mpg
- Manual transmission cars show higher mpg
- Multiple regression improved model performance (Adjusted R² ↑)
