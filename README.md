# Data Analytics Projects Portfolio
By William Barcelo

This repository contains my data analytics projects using Python, R, and (soon) SQL.  
Each project includes code, visualizations, and written analysis interpreting results.

## Projects

### 1. Student Exam Score Prediction – Python (scikit-learn)
Prediction model using the UCI Student Performance dataset.

Folder: [Project Folder](Projects/)

Notebook: [Jupyter Notebook](Projects/TestScoresProjectFinal.ipynb)

Highlights:
- Built regression models to predict final exam score ("G3")
- Improved model performance from R² = -0.018 → 0.708
- Used EDA, visualization (heatmaps, scatterplots), and feature engineering
- Identified strongest predictors — previous grades were most important

### 2. Fuel Efficiency Regression Analysis – R
Statistical modeling using the 'mtcars' dataset.

Folder: [Project Folder](Projects/)

File: [R Markdown](Projects/FuelEfficiencyProject.Rmd)

Highlights:
- Ran EDA to study relationship between mpg & vehicle traits
- Built simple vs multiple regression models; Adjusted R² improved
- Compared models with ANOVA and evaluated diagnostic plots
- Interpreted coefficients and visualized predictor influence
